             <h2> <br><br>Orgin Of SainLarent</h2>
             <p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Saint Laurent, a fashion brand launched in Paris by designer Yves Saint Laurent in 1961, renamed it Saint Laurent from Yves Saint Laurent in 2012. Saint Laurent started the brand with Haut Couture, a high-end custom outfit that was a typical fashion form of the 1960s, but introduced the ready-to-wear brand "Rive Gauche" in 1966, introducing a young street sensibility to fashion at the time when it was all about elegance. Saint Laurent became a fashion designer and brand along with Christian Dior and Coco Chanel in the 20th century, presenting "Le Smoking," which is considered to have freed women from gender discrimination, and "Mondrian Collection," a representative example of introducing art into fashion. </p>

               <h2><br><br><br>The Age of New Creative Directors<br><br><br></h2>
               <p> Yves Saint Laurent's Creative Director was followed by Tom Ford and led the brand until 2012 by Italian designer Stefano Pilati in 2005. Stefano Pilati, who has a career in Armani men's clothing and Miu Miu, has been favored by many with his signature classic sensibility and manner of honoring Yves Saint Laurent.
                  In March 2012, former Dior Homme designer Eddie Slimane was recruited as the creative director of Saint Laurent. In addition, the brand name was changed from Yves Saint Laurent to Saint Laurent Paris. In an interview with "Vogue" Paris in August 2012, Eddie Slyman asked why he changed his name to "Saint Laurent," because he thought it was essential for Saint Laurent to regain the orthodoxy of luxury red-tootware. I wanted to revive the spirit of the historic moment in which Laurent Liv Gossi, born in 1966, was born," he said. Saint Laurent, currently reinterpreted by Eddie Slyman, has the direction of "Au Masculin," "Le Tailleur" and "Dressing Up."</p>

                 <p> In 1965, Yves Saint Laurent presented the Mondrian dress in the fall and winter collections. The Mondrian dress is a print version of Piet Mondrian's "Composition with Red, Yellow and Blue," a September 1965 edition of Harper's Bazaar, a collection of distinctly white dresses. The Mondrian dress was recorded as the most photographed garment in the history of the fashion magazine, and it was Yves Saint Laurent's chance to make sure his name was recognized in the world. </p>
